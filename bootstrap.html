       <h2>Introduction to Spring Diving</h2>
        <p>
            While any place in the Carribean can boast about pristine blue waters and vibrant coral reefs; what makes Florida the dive capital of the world?  To find the answer, you have to leave the salt behind and start thinking fresh.  Florida's aquifer feeds thousands of springs that bubble up into rivers, lakes, and even caverns; many of which make for uniquely amazing dives.  In most spring dives not connected to other bodies of water you will find a rocky world devoid of life that makes you feel as if you are scuba diving on the moon.  Other dives you can see the vast array of fish, plants, and reptiles that depend on these springs and are very different than your usual salty species.  Additionally, all the dives I will discuss only <em>require an open water certification</em> to dive! This sounds great, but there are some unique properties that almost all spring dives have that is important to note before diving in.  There are many benefits to spring diving but also a lot more unseen dangers to look out for while your below the surface.

                <h3>Pros of Spring Dives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easier to navigate and get your bearings:</strong> most spring dives take place in confined caverns or rivers, so you don't have to worry about straying too far from the boat or a current sweeping you up and making you swim farther.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Visibility is consistently great:</strong> unless your dive buddy kicks up silt on the bottom, the water is consistently crystal clear</li>
                    <li><strong>Spring dives are usually cheaper:</strong> since there is no need to rent a charter boat, spring dives are usually cheaper event though a lot of them are on private property and there are fees to get in. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Dangers of Spring Dives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Buoyancy control skills are a must:</strong> if your buoyancy control skills aren't great, a spring dive can be very difficult.  You might easily find yourself on the bottom scraping against rocks or hitting your head on the top of a cavern.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Going too far:</strong> while most dives block sections that lead into dangerous parts of the cavern and use "Grim Reaper" signs, it is still a potential risk.  Just remember this mantra:  "There are old divers and bold divers, but never both"</li>

                Devil's Den is a very unique spring dive, as it is a spring inside a sinkhole.  With depths of up to 50 feet, this cavern is filled with tight swim-throughs and interesting rock formations.  The site is roughly dome-shaped, where the shallowest part of the cavern is in the middle where the platform is and the deepest parts are on the edges of the cavern.  For this reason, I suggest you start at the wall at the deepest parts and go around in a circle until you've seen it all.  Then, do your 3 minute safety stop more towards the middle and exploring the shallower areas.  Be careful to watch out for swimmers though, this place can get pretty crowded in the summer months.  If you dive it a second time in the same day, I suggest going in the opposite direction than you did the first time around the circle and go through the same swim-throughs backwards.  There are many entrances to deeper parts of the cave that have been blocked off to prevent divers from going further, including many "Grim Reaper" signs.  This is very helpful because it denotes the difference between a fun swim-through and a journey to the center of the earth.

                This spring-fed river is a great opportunity to test your drift diving skills and is a great chance to see a lot of Florida's freshwater wildlife.  In my many dives here I have seen everything from anhingas swimming next to me in search of food to giant alligator snapping turtles waiting for unsuspecting fish.  If you are looking for an up-close and personal experience with nature, this is the dive for you.  What most divers do is take the water taxi up the river (this usually costs about 15 dollars) and then drift dive back along the current to KP Hole.  Make sure to bring a dive flag because this is one of few spring dives that has a lot of boat traffic.  You want to be especially cautious of boats because certain spots in the river are very shallow.  Depths vary from 4ft to 20ft, and can change very quickly so make sure your buoyancy control skills are up to the challenge.

                Ginnie Springs is a hotspot for cave divers, but the main cavern at Ginnie Springs is open to open water divers too.  The main cavern is a huge ballroom-style cavern that goes down to depths of 60 feet.  There is a metal grate blocking the entrance to deeper parts in the aquifer, but it is fun to swim (or crawl) up to the grate and feel the force of the water rushing by you.  If you camp there overnight, you can do something called a "Galaxy Dive" where you dive the cavern at night and bring down non-toxic glow sticks down with you.  Once at the bottom of the cavern, crack the glowsticks, turn off your flashlights, and break open the glowsticks to let the fluid flow out.  The force of the water turns the glowstick liquid into a galaxy of little beads and it is breathtaking.  You feel as if you are a god swimming through the stars in the vastness of space.  Just be careful to keep an eye on your computer!  It is easy to be mesmerized by the beauty of a galaxy dive.

            <p class = "col-md-6">
                Blue Grotto is a fantastic dive if you are new to spring diving and overhead environments.  With depths of up to 110 feet, you can see the surface for at least 70 feet, making this a less stressful overhead environment dive.  Blue grotto has a very unique man-made feature too: a pressurized bell. This pressurized bell continuously delivers compressed air to a small bell that divers can swim under and breath air without using their own tank air.  It is pretty cool, but also very spooky because of how unnatural it feels.  Remember too that even though you are not using up the air in your tank you still need to pay attention to your No-deco times on your computer.  Speaking of decompression, there are a lot of great platforms at this dive site to spend your 3 minute safety stop at.  There is also a friendly soft-shelled turtle named "Virgil" that is very curious of divers and loves to be pet. They will warn you, however, not to hold her down as it can stress her out that she can't get to the surface if she needs to.

                Going to Paradise Springs is as much of an adventure as actually diving it!  I say this because the dive site is <em>literally in someone's backyard</em>.  You drive up to this guy's house, watch the safety video in his garage and you jump in!  As you can see in the photo, the entrance to the cavern is very small and not many divers can fit on the surface at one time, but trust me, it's bigger on the inside.  This cavern opens up tremendously and goes down to 120 ft.  This is a popular spot for cavern diving checkout dives and cave training in the deeper spots of the cavern, but the shallower regions are perfect for open water divers.  There are <em>tons</em> of fossils in this dive: sand dollars the size of dinner plates, whale bones, and other tiny fossils to catch the eye.  Most of the fossils are in the ceiling, so don't be afraid to look up every once in a while!  While the water is spring fed, it is very easily silted up, especially while trainings are occuring.

            <p class = "col-md-6">
                Hudson Grotto is one of the most challenging freshwater dives in Florida.  It starts off as a brackish dive with very low visibility, and then as you go deeper you go through a hydrogen sulfide layer where the spring water and brackish water meet and the visibility is dramatically improved.  The grotto reaches depths of up to 100 feet and has various platforms at varying depths.  Guide ropes are a must in this dive, due to the lack of visibility and the abundance of hazards.  There is a fallen tree decorated with all sorts of beads and spooky stuff including mannequins and dolls that is very easy to run into because of the lack of visibility.  There is also a small sunken boat that guidelines from a platform lead to.  This dive is definitely not for the faint of heart, and with the visibility being so poor it is easy to lose your sense of how deep you are, so keep an eye on that pressure gauge!
